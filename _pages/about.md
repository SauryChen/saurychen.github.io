<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an (INTJ) Ph.D candidate at [Department of Earth System Science](https://www.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn). My major is atmospheric science, and I currently conduct research at the intersection of atmospheric science and artificial intelligence. I started working with Prof. [Haohuan Fu](http://www.thuhpgc.net/mediawiki/index.php/Haohuan_Fu) in Fall 2021, prior to that, I got my Bachelor's degree at [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), majoring in Mechanical Engineering.

[ResU‚ÄêDeep: Improving the Trigger Function of Deep Convection in Tropical Regions With Deep Learning](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2022MS003521)

**Mengxuan Chen**, Haohuan Fu\*, Tao Zhang, Lanning Wang\* (2023)

- A location-aware and deep-learning-based deep convection trigger function is proposed to improve the diurnal cycle simulation in tropics. Results show that terrain information, temporal dependence of convection, and water vapor content are essential for predicting convection. Also, including information from neighboring atmospheric columns can improve the performance of the deep convection trigger function.
